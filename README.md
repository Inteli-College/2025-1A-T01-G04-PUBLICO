## ✅ Deliverable: Full Systematic Literature Review (Part 1 of 4)

This sprint concludes the first major milestone of my undergraduate thesis: a comprehensive **systematic review** of current methods and challenges in **AI-driven, self-paced adaptive learning for K–12 education**.

## 🔍 Summary

Despite the growing interest in adaptive learning systems, most research has focused on higher education. This review investigates how recent AI-based systems are being developed, personalized, and validated in **K–12 contexts**, which have unique pedagogical needs and lower rates of autonomy.

From an initial pool of **1,031 articles**, 31 studies (published from **2020 to 2025**) were selected based on strict inclusion criteria: algorithm-driven adaptivity, focus on core academic subjects, and empirical validation.

The review provides a structured synthesis across:

- **Student Modeling Approaches**: Knowledge Tracing, Cognitive Diagnosis, Matrix Factorization
- **Domain Knowledge Representation**: From expert-defined concept graphs to latent embeddings
- **Personalization Mechanisms**: Learning path recommendation, content selection, exercise generation, and difficulty sequencing
- **Implementation and Evaluation**: Common subjects, validation methods, real-world deployments, and key findings
- **Challenges and Future Directions**: Emphasis on explainability, motivation modeling, integration of LLMs, and the lack of RCTs
