# Generative AI–Based Adaptive Instruction in K–12 Mathematics

This repository contains all artifacts produced during a **year-long undergraduate Final Course Project (2025)** at the **Institute of Technology and Leadership (INTELI)**.
The project investigates the **feasibility and limitations of generative AI–based adaptive learning systems in K–12 mathematics**, combining a systematic literature review, system design and implementation, empirical classroom validation, and scientific dissemination.

Rather than documenting a single experiment or prototype, this repository reflects the **entire research lifecycle**, structured across **four academic modules**.

## Project Overview

* **Research focus:** Adaptive learning, generative AI, and curriculum-aligned personalization for K–12 education
* **Target domain:** 8th-grade mathematics
* **Approach:** Longitudinal, modular research combining theory, system development, and empirical validation
* **Outputs:**

  * One **systematic literature review**
  * One **functional adaptive learning system (artifact)**
  * Two **academic papers** (one literature-based, one empirical)

## Module Descriptions

### Module 13 — Systematic Literature Review

Contains the protocol, screening process, and synthesis of a **systematic literature review (SLR)** on AI-driven adaptive learning systems for K–12 education.
The review analyzes student modeling approaches, domain knowledge representation, personalization mechanisms, and evaluation practices.

### Module 14 — System Design and Prototype Development

Documents the **design and implementation of a web-based adaptive learning system**, emphasizing:

* curriculum-aligned knowledge representation,
* transparent student modeling,
* and generative AI–based adaptive explanations.

This phase prioritizes feasibility and pedagogical interpretability over algorithmic complexity.

### Module 15 — Empirical Validation in a Classroom Context

Includes materials related to the **quasi-experimental classroom study** conducted with 8th-grade mathematics students, such as:

* study design,
* assessment instruments,
* anonymized interaction data,
* and analysis scripts.

All data were anonymized, and ethical research practices were followed.

### Module 16 — Scientific Consolidation and Publication

Consolidates the outputs of the previous modules into **academic manuscripts** submitted for peer-reviewed publication, representing the scientific culmination of the project.
